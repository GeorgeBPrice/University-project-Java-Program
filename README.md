# University-project-Java-Program
A small program built using Java and NetBeans

This little sample program was made using NetBeans and Java, for the Object-Oriented Programming unit. 

Here I was learning Java and general OOP concepts. Emphasis was placed on producing clean code, observing programming conventions, using sensible commenting, and striving for good quality results.

I could improve the usability of this small program, by implementing the following:
1.	Search for installation jobs by customer name.
2.	Search for installation jobs by date/s.
3.	Implement and attach a MySQL database, and store customers, technicians, and installation jobs there.
4.	Allow the printing and exporting of Job installations to PDF or Excel.
5.	Allow the program UI screen to be resized, made full screen, and responsive for mobile devices.
6.	Improve the readability and visual output of installation jobs on the main screen.
7.	Add form elements, such as date popup/selectors, and address fields such as street/state/postcode.
